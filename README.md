# AstroCore
## Core mod for AstroGreg:Exsilium

### What does this mod do?
This mod adds features specifically intended for the AstroGreg:Exsilium mod pack, 
mostly for our high quality Botania integration.

### Is it compatible with other projects?
It isn't advisable, but with some of your own KubeJS work to give the casings and other items their
own recipes you *could* make it work. Currently there aren't any mixins or anything crazy like that
but overall it still isn't intended for use in other projects.
If you would like specific features to be made into a "standalone" GT addon, you can always request
it from our team for consideration.

### Credits
Written by the collective AstroGreg Team. This mod currently contains examples from [Screcret](https://github.com/screret)
and [JuiceyBean](https://github.com/JuiceyBeans)'s [GT Addon Template](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Addon-Template?tab=readme-ov-file).

Mod would not be possible without heavily referencing [PhoenixVine](https://github.com/Phoenixvine32908)'s [PhoenixCore](https://github.com/Phoenixvine32908/PhoenixCore/) for  file structure.

If you are looking for our mod pack, we have a separate repository for that on [this page](https://github.com/HazeVista/AstroGregExsilium).

Thanks for checking it out! -Haze Vista
